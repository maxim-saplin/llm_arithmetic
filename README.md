# llm_arithmetic

A Python harness to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) across varying numeric depths and data types.

## Features

- Supports integer and fixed-point float arithmetic
- Parametrized digit depths (2 to 10)
- Generates random test operands with controlled valid inputs (e.g., integer division always yields integer results)
- Prompts LLMs via `litellm.completion`
- Parses numeric responses with regex
- Classifies results as `Correct`, `Deviate`, or `NaN`
- Records token usage and timing
- Outputs per-trial JSONL and updates an aggregate JSONL summary

## Testing Rules and Constraints

- **Integer operands**:
  - Depth *d*: values from $10^{d-1}$ to $10^d - 1$
  - `int_div` pairs are constructed so division yields an exact integer result

- **Floating-point operands**:
  - Inputs have two decimal places (fixed-point scale 0.01)
  - Depth *d*: base magnitudes from $10^{d-1}$ to $10^d - 1$ before scaling
  - Addition/Subtraction: exact two decimal places
  - Multiplication/Division: results quantized to four decimal places

- **Prompting & parsing**:
  - Models receive: "Compute the following and reply with just the numeric result (no explanation)"
  - Responses are parsed via regex and classified as:
    - `Correct`: exact match to the computed result
    - `Deviate`: numeric but off â€“ logged with absolute error
    - `NaN`: non-numeric or parsing failure

- **Trials & depths**:
  - Default 10 trials per variant/depth combination
  - Default depths: 2 through 10 digits

- **Outputs**:
  - Per-trial JSONL written to the configured results directory
  - A summary record appended to `aggregate.jsonl` at project root

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
 git clone <repo_url>
 cd llm_arithmetic
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your API key environment variable

```bash
 export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Alternatively, create a `.env` file at the project root with the following content:

```env
 OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
 MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
```

## Usage

Run the evaluation suite with:

```bash
 python run.py --model <model> --trials 10 --depths 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 --output_dir results
```
