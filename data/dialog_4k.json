With 30 minutes of focused daily practice, you could see significant improvement in about 3-6 months. Since you played before, your progress would likely be faster as your muscles might retain some memory.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- First month: Rebuilding finger strength and basic chord transitions\n- 2-3 months: Comfortable with common chord progressions and simple songs\n- 4-6 months: Playing complete songs smoothly with more advanced techniques\n\nThe key is consistency – 30 minutes daily is much more effective than 3 hours once a week.

Rail trails (converted railway paths) which are usually flat and accessible\n4. Lakeside or riverside trails that tend to be less steep\n\nThe best approach is to search for trails near your specific location. Many apps like AllTrails let you filter by difficulty, length, and elevation gain.

Latourell Falls – A 2.4-mile loop with beautiful waterfall views\n2. Wahkeena Falls to Multnomah Falls – Can be adjusted in length but offers spectacular scenery\n3. Catherine Creek – Especially beautiful in spring with wildflowers\n4. Beacon Rock – Short but rewarding with panoramic views\n5. Eagle Creek to Punch Bowl Falls – Slightly more challenging but incredibly scenic\n\nThe PNW also offers amazing hiking in places like Mount Rainier National Park, Olympic National Park, and countless forest trails. Just be prepared for rain even in summer, layer appropriately, and always let someone know your hiking plans. The mossy forests and waterfall-filled gorges make it one of the most magical hiking regions in the country!"

Additional costs might include pet insurance ($10-40/month) and boarding when you travel ($15-30/day).\n\nCats are generally more affordable than dogs overall, especially considering you won’t need dog walking services when you travel for work.
